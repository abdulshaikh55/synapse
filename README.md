# SYNAPSE

This project is a Learning Management System (LMS) that leverages a recommender system to personalize the learning experience for each user. It aims to provide relevant and engaging content based on user preferences, learning history, and performance.

## Features

* **User Management:**
    * User registration and authentication.
    * User profiles with learning preferences and progress tracking.
* **Course Management:**
    * Creation and management of courses, modules, and lessons.
    * Content upload (text, video, quizzes, etc.).
* **Recommender System:**
    * Personalized course and content recommendations based on:
        * User's learning history.
        * User's performance on quizzes and assignments.
        * User's stated interests and preferences.
        * Collaborative filtering.
        * Content based filtering.
    * Continual model retraining based on user interactions.
* **Learning Progress Tracking:**
    * Detailed tracking of user progress within courses.
    * Reporting and analytics on user performance.
* **Quizzes and Assessments:**
    * Creation and management of quizzes and assignments.
    * Automated grading and feedback.
* **Search and Filtering:**
    * Ability to search and filter courses and content.
* **User Feedback:**
    * Ability for users to rate and review courses.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Python/Django, Node.js/Express
* **Frontend:** React
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Recommender System Libraries:** scikit-learn

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository directory]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # Example for Python with pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Example for Node.js with npm
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the database:**

    * Create a database and configure the connection settings in the application's configuration file.
    * Run database migrations (if applicable).

4.  **Configure the recommender system:**

    * Prepare the data for training the recommender model.
    * Train the model using the provided scripts or notebooks.
    * Configure the model's location and parameters in the application configuration.

5.  **Start the application:**

    ```bash
    # Example for Python/Django
    python manage.py runserver

    # Example for Node.js/Express
    npm start
    ```

6.  **Access the application in your browser:**

    * Open `http://localhost:[port]` (or the configured URL) in your browser.

## Recommender System Details

The recommender system utilizes a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to provide personalized recommendations.

* **Collaborative Filtering:**
    * Analyzes user interactions and preferences to find similar users and recommend content they have enjoyed.
* **Content-Based Filtering:**
    * Analyzes the content of courses and lessons to recommend items similar to those the user has previously interacted with.
* **Hybrid Approach:**
    * Combines both collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation accuracy.
* **Model retraining:**
    * The recommender model is retrained periodically or in real-time to incorporate new user data and content updates.

## Future Enhancements

* **Integration with external learning platforms.**
* **Advanced analytics and reporting.**
* **Gamification features.**
* **Improved recommender system with deep learning models.**
* **Mobile app support.**
* **Social learning features.**
* **Implementing a Content Delivery Network(CDN) for video and large file distribution.**
